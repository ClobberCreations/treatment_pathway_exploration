# 00 Patient trajectory analysis: GLP-1 RAs for weight loss code

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook of the code used in the University of Exeter MSc Health Data Science HPDM099 Final Project on patient treatment pathways with IQVIA.

Below is an outline of the R notebooks created to document the code.

-   [01 Event log to sequences table](./01_event_log_to_sequences_table.Rmd)

-   [02 Creating sequences with `TraMineR`](./02_creating_sequences_with_traminer.Rmd)

-   [03 Creating a time series clustering model](./03_creating_a_time_series_clustering_model.Rmd)

-   [04 Stratified sample model iterations](./04_stratified_sample_model_iterations.Rmd)

-   [05 Analysing models further](./05_analysing_models_further.Rmd)

-   [06 Producing summary tables from patient characteristics and treatment durations](./06_producing_summary_tables.Rmd)

A brief outline of the notebooks is below:

## [01 Event log to sequences table](./01_event_log_to_sequences_table.Rmd)

This notebook advises on how an event log was transformed into patient trajectories.

## [02 Creating sequences with `TraMineR`](./02_creating_sequences_with_traminer.Rmd)

This notebook demonstrates how the patient trajectory files were turned into a sequence object in `TraMineR` and then reviewed using the entropy and state distribution plots.

## [03 Creating a time series clustering model](./03_creating_a_time_series_clustering_model.Rmd)

The `TrajectoryAnalysis` class is introduced to create a time series clustering model.

## [04 Stratified sample model iterations](./04_stratified_sample_model_iterations.Rmd)

The code for iterating through different models and parameters is provided here.

## [05 Analysing models further](./05_analysing_models_further.Rmd)

Further functions for saving other plots for analysis are shown in this notebook.

## [06 Producing summary tables from patient characteristics and treatment durations](./06_producing_summary_tables.Rmd)

This notebook creates summary tables from the cohort information.
