This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook of the code used in the University of Exeter MSc Health Data Science HPDM099 Final Project on patient treatment pathways.

## 1. Set the working directory

First, we will set the working directory (amend if you are using a different working directory)

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "~/treatment_pathway_exploration")
```

Check the change has taken place.

```{r}
getwd()
```

## 2. Transform the event log into a sequence table

First, we will define the event log file as `event_log_file`.

```{r}
event_log_file <- "./data/GLP-1 RA first-use as anti-obesity medication (no diabetes)_Event.csv"
```

For this, we will load the function in another file.

```{r}
source("./code/events_to_sequences.r")
```

We need to create another couple of variables to highlight the columns to use in the data file as well as specifying any date columns.

```{r}
# specify the columns to use
col_names <- c("PatId",
               "EventDate",                                      
               "Gender",
               "Gender_Desc",                    
               "Age",
               "Age_Desc",                  
               "IndexDate",
               "GLP1_Count",                      
               "GLP1s",
               "GLP1_days_supply",                    
               "Other_Med_Class_Count",
               "Other_medications",
               "Other_medications_days_supply",
               "DULAGLUTIDE",                
               "EXENATIDE  (BYDUREON, BYETTA)",
               "SEMAGLUTIDE (OZEMPIC)",
               "LIRAGLUTIDE (VICTOZA)",
               "TIRZEPATIDE (MOUNJARO)",
               "LIXISENATIDE (ADLYXIN)",
               "LIRAGLUTIDE (SAXENDA)",
               "ALBIGLUTIDE (TANZEUM)",
               "SEMAGLUTIDE (WEGOVY)")

# specify the dat columns
date_cols <- c("EventDate",                  
               "IndexDate")
```

Next, we will run the function to save down a copy of the event log as a sequence table with the GLP-1 RAs grouped.

```{r}
sequence_format(event_log_file, col_names, date_cols = date_cols, combine_GLP1s = TRUE)
```

A copy with a separate state for every GLP-1 RA type can be saved down as well by setting `combine_GLP1s` to *FALSE*.

```{r}
sequence_format(event_log_file, col_names, date_cols = date_cols, combine_GLP1s = FALSE)
```
